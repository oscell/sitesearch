SiteSearch gives you a curated catalog of Algolia-powered search experiences. Copy the pieces you need, wire them to your data, and keep moving—no yak-shaving on autocomplete state machines or analytics plumbing.

Everything lives in your repo. You can read the source, fork it, and ship variants that match your product’s tone of voice.

## Prerequisites

- [Algolia account](https://dashboard.algolia.com/)
- [Algolia index](https://dashboard.algolia.com/indices)
- [Algolia API key](https://dashboard.algolia.com/api-keys)
- [Algolia Ask AI assistant](https://dashboard.algolia.com/ask-ai) (optional – only if you want to use Conversational Search)

## Why we built this

- **Move faster:** Borrow production-ready search patterns instead of prototyping from scratch.
- **Stay flexible:** Every component ships uncompiled. Change the layout, switch styling systems, or replace logic as your product evolves.
- **First-class Algolia:** We bake in search, insights, and AI answer patterns using Algolia best practices.
