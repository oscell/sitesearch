description: "Using SiteSearch with Vanilla JS"
---

We provide a vanilla version of the search experiences that can be used in any project.

Use our CDN bundle or customize to your needs with our [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/algolia/sitesearch) or clone the repository [github.com/algolia/sitesearch](https://github.com/algolia/sitesearch) and start iterating on the components [Advanced usage]. Feel free to use it as a starting point for building your own experiences. When you are happy with your changes, you can build the vanilla bundle and use it in your project.

## Prerequisites

- [Algolia prerequisites](/docs#prerequisites)

### Usage

We document how to use each experience in the [Experiences](/docs/experiences) section **under the VanillaJS tab**.

Typical example for the `search` experience:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@algolia/sitesearch@latest/dist/search.min.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@algolia/sitesearch@latest/dist/search.min.js"></script>
<div id="search"></div>
<script>
  SiteSearch.init({
    container: "#search",
    applicationId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    indexName: "YOUR_INDEX_NAME",
    attributes: {
      primaryText: "title", // the attribute to display in the hits list
      secondaryText: "description", // the secondary attribute to display in the hits list
      tertiaryText: "itunesAuthor", // the tertiary attribute to display in the hits list
      url: "url", // the URL of the hit
      image: "imageUrl", // the image URL of the hit
    },
  });
</script>
```

This code should already work out of the box with the bundled version.

## Vanilla JS experiences available via CDN

We provide bundled version & hosted versions of the all the vanilla search experiences. They are available via CDN and can be used in any project.

```html
<!-- styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@algolia/sitesearch@latest/dist/<experience-name>.min.css" />

<!-- scripts -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@algolia/sitesearch@latest/dist/<experience-name>.min.js"></script>

<!-- Replace <experience-name> with the name of the experience you want to use -->
```

<Callout title="Note">Always use the minified version of the experience to reduce the size of the bundle. (`.min.css` and `.min.js`).</Callout>
