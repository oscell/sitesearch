Like shadcn/ui, everything lives in your repo. You can read the source, edit it, and ship variants that match your product.

## Prerequisites

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) already initialized in your project (run `npx shadcn@latest init` if you haven't)
- A React project, version 18 or later
- [Other algolia prerequisites](/docs#prerequisites)

<Callout title="Important">Make sure you have a setup Tailwind CSS in your project, shadcn/ui uses Tailwind CSS for styling and the CSS variables mode for theming.</Callout>

## Installing components and experiences

You can install our search experiences using the standard shadcn/ui CLI. This adds the selected component's code and any needed dependencies to your project. For example, to install the default SiteSearch experience, you would run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @algolia/search
```

This will add the `Search` component to your project under `components/search`. Proceed to use it as described in the [Search experience](/docs/experiences/search) documentation.

All components are built with the shadcn/ui theming system, so you can easily customize the look and feel to match your brand.
